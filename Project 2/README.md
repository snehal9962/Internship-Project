## 🧠 Project Title: AI-Powered Task Management System

### 📋 Problem Statement

In many organizations, **task management is still manual**, inefficient, and error-prone. Employees often misjudge time estimations, leading to delays, poor resource management, and low productivity. This project aims to **build an AI-based system** to:

* Predict task durations
* Automatically assign priorities
* Monitor ongoing performance
* Optimize task scheduling using data-driven insights

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a machine learning model to **predict task completion time** based on historical data.
* Create a system that can **prioritize tasks dynamically** depending on deadlines, complexity, and dependencies.
* Analyze employee performance metrics to **optimize resource allocation**.
* Recommend **strategic improvements** using data visualization.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used includes the following fields:

* **Task ID**: Unique identifier
* **Task Description**: Brief of the assigned work
* **Assigned To**: Person/Team assigned
* **Start Date** and **End Date**
* **Estimated Duration** and **Actual Duration**
* **Priority Level**: High, Medium, Low
* **Task Category**: e.g., development, testing
* **Task Status**: Ongoing, Completed, Delayed

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights obtained through EDA:

* Task categories with the **highest delay rates**
* **Employees with the most consistent performance**
* Average time vs estimated time comparison
* Most frequent causes of task failure/delay

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

### 🔹 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Missing value imputation
* Categorical encoding (One-hot / Label encoding)
* Feature scaling (MinMaxScaler)
* Feature extraction (Day of week, Working hours, etc.)

### 🔹 Step 2: Model Building

Tested multiple algorithms:

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

**Best Performing Model**: Random Forest Regressor

### 🔹 Step 3: Evaluation

* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
* R² Score

Performance achieved:

| Model             | MAE  | RMSE | R² Score |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Random Forest     | 1.86 | 2.13 | 0.91     |
| Linear Regression | 3.22 | 4.08 | 0.74     |
